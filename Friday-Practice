At some time on Saturday I will listen to the one hour tutorial
Now I am adding text to this file
Proposing a change and making a new branch
How did you go with the Tutorials?
I did two.  One used the command line to demonstrate the basic concepts of commit, pull request, comment and merge.  The other was about using a local version to create branches and then using pull requests to share the changes with everyone.
